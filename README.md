# GraphicsSandbox
A repository that I use for playing around with real-time computer graphics.

# Known issues & TODOs
- Add Mesh and Model classes
- The transforms are acting a bit weird(Camera class)
- Clean up Sandbox.cpp(it's completely all over the place at this point)
- Movement is inconsistent relative to direciton
- Movement forward and backward is flipped for some reason

# Acknowledgement
Some of this code was written while following TheCherno's OpenGL tutorial series. Some of the code is also inspired by a course I'm currently taking(2020/2021).

# Libraries used
 - GLFW (https://www.glfw.org/)
 - GLAD (https://glad.dav1d.de/)
